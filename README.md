# Bootstrap-Portfolio

DEAR GOD I WAS AN IDIOT 3 WEEKS AGO.

Having a lot of trouble trying to get this looking presentable, a lot of things were done initially
by putting band-aids on, but when I'm trying to improve now they're getting in the way. The Portfolio
Page now has the images as links to various homeworks with a short description by them. I'm going to
continue working on this to make it more presentable and get a better understanding of bootstrap and
CSS in general.
