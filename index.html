                Almost like another Will, I was born and raised West of Philadelphia. Growing up I enjoyed playing various sports including ice hockey, lacrosse, swimming, and rowing.

                I studied Math and Physics at Temple University and continued my love of sports by taking up canoe paddling on the Schuylkill river. I was fortunate enough to earn a spot on the U.S. national dragonboat team in 2015 and 2017 and hope to make it again in the upcoming Summer of 2019.

                My latest adventure highlights a comittment to begin a new career in the field of software development. With a love for technology and problem solving, it made perfect sense to explore the programming field. The puzzle-like challenge that is learning & compiling code has kept me invested in the process. I look forward to more challenges and creating useful pages and applications for people to use.
